At this point in the project, it is hard to say how you should and should not contribute. The design decisions and direction of the project are likely not clear at this point. Therefore, I would ask that you please submit an issue before working on any major contribution; this way, we can have some dialogue about what you would like to do and how you would like to implement it so that I can be sure it will align with my plans for the project. I may reject contributions if they don't fit with my design plan, and I don't want your time to be wasted on a major contribution if I can't implement it when you're finished.

Most importantly, be respectful towards each other and to me. We are all human, and on the other end of a computer someone else has to read what you write. Please keep it civil.
